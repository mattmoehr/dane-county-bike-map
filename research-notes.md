## Notes on existing bike maps

### Mapbox

- https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-studio-run-bike-and-hike.tm2
  - This is the old carto CSS but maybe informative for style tips?
- https://www.mapbox.com/help/overpass-turbo/
  - Helpful tutorial for bringing in OSM data.
  - What is Overpass Turbo? Maybe it's an API run by OSM?
  
### OpenStreetMap

- Details on bike features: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle
- Feature tag `cycleway=*`
- Besides the cycleway tag, also remember:
  - amenities for bike parking
  - barriers for bikes
  - `highway:footway` with `bicycle=yes`
  - `highway:path` with `highway=cycleway`
- Cycle routes: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cycle_routes

### OpenCycleMap

- http://www.opencyclemap.org/
- These are rendered tiles. They seem to open for download, but they can not be styled. I think.

### National Park Service

- Tom Patterson (www.shadedrelief.com) makes awesome maps that are kind to the user.
- Here are some symbols from NPS https://www.nps.gov/hfc/carto/map-symbols.cfm
